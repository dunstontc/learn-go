| String    | A string type represents the set of string values. A string value is a (possibly empty) sequence of bytes. <br> Strings are immutable: once created, it is impossible to change the contents of a string.                                                                                                | `string`    |
| Array     | An array is a numbered sequence of elements of a single type, called the element type. The number of elements is called the length and is never negative.                                                                                                                                                |             |
| Slice     | A slice is a descriptor for a contiguous segment of an underlying array and provides access to a numbered sequence of elements from that array. A slice type denotes the set of all slices of arrays of its element type. The value of an uninitialized slice is nil.                                    |             |
| Struct    | A struct is a sequence of named elements, called fields, each of which has a name and a type. <br> Field names may be specified explicitly (IdentifierList) or implicitly (EmbeddedField). Within a struct, non-blank field names must be unique.                                                        | `struct {}` |
| Pointer   | A pointer type denotes the set of all pointers to variables of a given type, called the base type of the pointer. <br> The value of an uninitialized pointer is nil.                                                                                                                                     | `*Point`    |
| Function  | A function type denotes the set of all functions with the same parameter and result types.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |             |
| Interface | An interface type specifies a method set called its interface. A variable of interface type can store a value of any type with a method set that is any superset of the interface. Such a type is said to implement the interface. <br> The value of an uninitialized variable of interface type is nil. |             |
| Map       | A map is an unordered group of elements of one type, called the element type, indexed by a set of unique keys of another type, called the key type.                                                                                                                                                      |             |
| Channel   | A channel provides a mechanism for concurrently executing functions to communicate by sending and receiving values of a specified element type. <br> The value of an uninitialized channel is nil.                                                                                                       |             |
| Nil       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | `nil`       |
