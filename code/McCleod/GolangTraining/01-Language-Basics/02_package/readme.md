# Packages

- one folder, many files
  - package declaration in every file
  - package scope
    - something in one file is accessible to another file
  - imports have file scope
- exported / unexported 
  - aka, visible / not visible
  - we don't say (generally speaking): public / private
  - capitalization
    - capitalize: exported, visible outside the package
    - lowercase: unexported, not visible outside the package
