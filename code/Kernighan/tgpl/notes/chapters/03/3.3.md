## 3.3. Complex Numbers 

Go provides two sizes of complex numbers, `complex64` and `complex128`, whose components are `float32` and `float64` respectively. The built-in function `complex` creates a complex number from its real and imaginary components, and the built-in `real` and `imag` functions extract those components:
```go
  var x complex128 = complex(1, 2) // 1+2i
  var y complex128 = complex(3, 4) // 3+4i
  fmt.Println(x*y)                 // "(-5+10i)"
  fmt.Println(real(x*y))           // "-5"
  fmt.Println(imag(x*y))           // "10"
```

If a floating-point literal or decimal integer literal is immediately followed by `i`, such as `3.141592i` or `2i`, it becomes an *imaginary literal*, denoting a complex number with a zero real component:
```go
  fmt.Println(1i * 1i) // "(-1+0i)", $i^2$ = -1
```

Under the rules for constant arithmetic, complex constants can be added to other constants (integer or floating point, real or imaginary), allowing us to write complex numbers naturally, like `1+2i`, or equivalently, `2i+1`. The declarations of `x` and `y` above can be simplified:
```go
  x := 1 + 2i
  y := 3 + 4i
```

Complex numbers may be compared for equality with `==` and `!=`. Two complex numbers are equal if their real parts are equal and their imaginary parts are equal.

The `math/cmplx` package provides library functions for working with complex numbers, such as the complex square root and exponentiation functions.
```go
  fmt.Println(cmplx.Sqrt(-1)) // "(0+1i)"
```

The following program uses `complex128` arithmetic to generate a [Mandelbrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set).
```go
// tgpl.io/ch3/mandelbrot
// Mandelbrot emits a PNG image of the Mandelbrot fractal.
package main

import (
	"image"
	"image/color"
	"image/png"
	"math/cmplx"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	const (
		xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax = -2, -2, +2, +2
		width, height          = 1024, 1024
	)

	img := image.NewRGBA(image.Rect(0, 0, width, height))
	for py := 0; py < height; py++ {
		y := float64(py)/height*(ymax-ymin) + ymin
		for px := 0; px < width; px++ {
			x := float64(px)/width*(xmax-xmin) + xmin
			z := complex(x, y)
			// Image point (px, py) represents complex value z.
			img.Set(px, py, mandelbrot(z))
		}
	}
	png.Encode(os.Stdout, img) // NOTE: ignoring errors
}

func mandelbrot(z complex128) color.Color {
	const iterations = 200
	const contrast = 15

	var v complex128
	for n := uint8(0); n < iterations; n++ {
		v = v*v + z
		if cmplx.Abs(v) > 2 {
			return color.Gray{255 - contrast*n}
		}
	}
	return color.Black
}
```

The two nested loops iterate over each point in a 1024x1024 grayscale raster image representing the −2 to +2 portion of the complex plane. The program tests whether repeatedly squaring and adding the number that point represents eventually "escapes" the circle of radius 2. If so, the point is shaded by the number of iterations it took to escape. If not, the value belongs to the Mandelbrot set, and the point remains black. Finally, the program writes to its standard output the PNG-encoded image of the iconic fractal, shown in Figure 3.3.

### Exercises

- **Exercise 3.5**: Implement a full-color Mandelbrot set using the function `image.NewRGBA` and the type `color.RGBA` or `color.YCbCr`.
- **Exercise 3.6**: Supersampling is a technique to reduce the effect of pixelation by computing the color value at several points within each pixel and taking the average. The simplest method is to divide each pixel into four "subpixels." Implement it.
- **Exercise 3.7**: Another simple fractal uses Newton's method to find complex solutions to a function such as $z^4−1 = 0$. Shade each starting point by the number of iterations required to get close to one of the four roots. Color each point by the root it approaches.

- **Exercise 3.8**: Rendering fractals at high zoom levels demands great arithmetic precision. Implement the same fractal using four different representations of numbers: `complex64`, `complex128`, `big.Float`, and `big.Rat`. (The latter two types are found in the `math/big` package. `Float` uses arbitrary but bounded-precision floating-point; `Rat` uses unbounded-precision rational numbers.) How do they compare in performance and memory usage? At what zoom levels do rendering artifacts become visible?
- **Exercise 3.9**: Write a web server that renders fractals and writes the image data to the client. Allow the client to specify the *x*, *y*, and zoom values as parameters to the HTTP request.
