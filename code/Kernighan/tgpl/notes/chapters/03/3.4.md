## 3.4. Booleans 

A value of type `bool`, or *boolean*, has only two possible values, `true` and `false`. The conditions in `if` and `for` statements are booleans, and comparison operators like `==` and `<` produce a boolean result. The unary operator `!` is logical negation, so `!true` is `false`, or, one might say, `(!true==false)==true`, although as a matter of style, we always simplify redundant boolean expressions like `x==true` to `x`.

Boolean values can be combined with the `&&` (AND) and `||` (OR) operators, which have *shortcircuit* behavior: if the answer is already determined by the value of the left operand, the right operand is not evaluated, making it safe to write expressions like this:
```go
  s != "" && s[0] == 'x'
```
where `s[0]` would panic if applied to an empty string.

Since `&&` has higher precedence than `||` (mnemonic: `&&` is boolean multiplication, `||` is boolean addition), no parentheses are required for conditions of this form:
```go
  if 'a' <= c && c <= 'z' ||
     'A' <= c && c <= 'Z' ||
     '0' <= c && c <= '9' {
     // ...ASCII letter or digit...
  }
```
There is no implicit conversion from a boolean value to a numeric value like 0 or 1, or vice versa. It's necessary to use an explicit `if`, as in
```go
  i := 0 if b {
      i=1
  }
```
It might be worth writing a conversion function if this operation were needed often:
```go
  // btoi returns 1 if b is true and 0 if false.
  func btoi(b bool) int {
      if b { 
          return 1
      }
      return 0
  }
```
The inverse operation is so simple that it doesn't warrant a function, but for symmetry here it is:
```go

  // itob reports whether i is non-zero.
  func itob(i int) bool { return i != 0 }
```
