It’s all bits at the bottom, of course, but computers operate fundamentally on fixed-size numbers called *words*, which are interpreted as integers, floating-point numbers, bit sets, or memory addresses, then combined into larger aggregates that represent packets, pixels, portfolios, poetry, and everything else. Go offers a variety of ways to organize data, with a spectrum of data types that at one end match the features of the hardware and at the other end provide what programmers need to conveniently represent complicated data structures.

Go’s types fall into four categories: *basic types*, *aggregate types*, *reference types*, and *interface types*. Basic types, the topic of this chapter, include numbers, strings, and booleans. Aggregate types—arrays (§4.1) and structs (§4.4)—form more complicated data types by combining val- ues of several simpler ones. Reference types are a diverse group that includes pointers (§2.3.2), slices (§4.2), maps (§4.3), functions (Chapter 5), and channels (Chapter 8), but what they have in common is that they all refer to program variables or state indirectly, so that the effect of an operation applied to one reference is observed by all copies of that reference. Finally, we’ll talk about interface types in Chapter 7.

## 3.1. Integers 

Go’s numeric data types include several sizes of integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers. Each numeric type determines the size and signedness of its values. Let’s begin with integers.

Go provides both signed and unsigned integer arithmetic. There are four distinct sizes of signed integers—8, 16, 32, and 64 bits—represented by the types `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, and `int64`, and corresponding unsigned versions `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, and `uint64`.

There are also two types called just `int` and `uint` that are the natural or most efficient size for signed and unsigned integers on a particular platform; int is by far the most widely used numeric type. Both these types have the same size, either 32 or 64 bits, but one must not make assumptions about which; different compilers may make different choices even on identical hardware.

The type `rune` is an synonym for `int32` and conventionally indicates that a value is a Unicode code point. The two names may be used interchangeably. Similarly, the type `byte` is an synonym for `uint8`, and emphasizes that the value is a piece of raw data rather than a small numeric quantity.

Finally, there is an unsigned integer type `uintptr`, whose width is not specified but is sufficient to hold all the bits of a pointer value. The `uintptr` type is used only for low-level programming, such as at the boundary of a Go program with a C library or an operating system. We’ll see examples of this when we deal with the unsafe package in Chapter 13.

Regardless of their size, `int`, `uint`, and `uintptr` are different types from their explicitly sized siblings. Thus `int` is not the same type as `int32`, even if the natural size of integers is 32 bits, and an explicit conversion is required to use an `int` value where an `int32` is needed, and vice versa.

Signed numbers are represented in *Two's-complement* [*0*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKTsv6iVxV4&t=188s) [*1*](https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/26jnqu/im_having_trouble_understanding_twos_compliment/) [*2*](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1049880/7687024)  form, in which the high-order bit is reserved for the sign of the number and the range of values of an *n*-bit number is from $−2^{n−1}$ to $2^{n−1}−1$. Unsigned integers use the full range of bits for non-negative values and thus have the range 0 to $2^n−1$. For instance, the range of `int8` is −128 to 127, whereas the range of `uint8` is 0 to 255.

Go’s binary [operators](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Operators) for arithmetic, logic, and comparison are listed here in order of decreasing precedence:
```
  *    /    %    <<    >>    &    &^    
  +    -    |    ^
  ==   !=   <    <=    >     >=
  &&
  ||
```
There are only five levels of precedence for binary operators. Operators at the same level associate to the left, so parentheses may be required for clarity, or to make the operators evaluate in the intended order in an expression like `mask & (1 << 28)`.

Each operator in the first two lines of the table above, for instance `+`, has a corresponding assignment operator like `+=` that may be used to abbreviate an assignment statement.

The integer arithmetic operators `+,` `-,` `*,` and `/` may be applied to integer, floating-point, and complex numbers, but the remainder operator `%` applies only to integers. The behavior of `%` for negative numbers varies across programming languages. In Go, the sign of the remainder is always the same as the sign of the dividend, so `-5 % 3` and `-5 % -3` are both `-2`. The behavior of `/` depends on whether its operands are integers, so `5.0/4.0` is `1.25`, but `5/4` is `1` because integer division truncates the result toward zero.

If the result of an arithmetic operation, whether signed or unsigned, has more bits than can be represented in the result type, it is said to *overflow*. The high-order bits that do not fit are silently discarded. If the original number is a signed type, the result could be negative if the leftmost bit is a 1, as in the `int8` example here:
```go
  var u uint8 = 255
  fmt.Println(u, u+1, u*u) // "255 0 1"
  var i int8 = 127
  fmt.Println(i, i+1, i*i) // "127 -128 1"
```
Two integers of the same type may be compared using the binary comparison operators below; the type of a comparison expression is a boolean.
```
  ==    equal to
  !=    not equal to
  <     less than
  <=    less than or equal to
  >     greater than
  >=    greater than or equal to
```

In fact, all values of basic type—booleans, numbers, and strings—are *comparable*, meaning that two values of the same type may be compared using the `==` and `!=` operators. Furthermore, integers, floating-point numbers, and strings are *ordered* by the comparison operators. The values of many other types are not comparable, and no other types are ordered. As we encounter each type, we’ll present the rules governing the *comparability* of its values.

There are also unary addition and subtraction operators:
```
  +    unary positive (no effect)
  -    unary negation
```
For integers, `+x` is a shorthand for `0+x` and `-x` is a shorthand for `0-x`; for floating-point and complex numbers, `+x` is just `x` and `-x` is the negation of `x`.

Go also provides the following bitwise binary operators, the first four of which treat their operands as bit patterns with no concept of arithmetic carry or sign:
```
  &    bitwise AND
  |    bitwise OR
  ^    bitwise XOR
  &^   bit clear (AND NOT) << left shift
  >>   right shift
```

The operator `^` is bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) when used as a binary operator, but when used as a unary prefix operator it is bitwise negation or complement; that is, it returns a value with each bit in its operand inverted. The `&^` operator is bit clear (AND NOT): in the expression  `z = x &^ y`, each bit of `z` is `0` if the corresponding bit of `y` is `1`; otherwise it equals the corresponding bit of `x`.

The code below shows how bitwise operations can be used to interpret a `uint8` value as a compact and efficient set of 8 independent bits. It uses `Printf`’s `%b` verb to print a number’s binary digits; `08` modifies `%b` (an adverb!) to pad the result with zeros to exactly 8 digits.
```go
  var x uint8 = 1<<1 | 1<<5
  var y uint8 = 1<<1 | 1<<2
  fmt.Printf("%08b\n", x)    // "00100010", the set {1, 5}
  fmt.Printf("%08b\n", y)    // "00000110", the set {1, 2}
  fmt.Printf("%08b\n", x&y)  // "00000010", the intersection {1}
  fmt.Printf("%08b\n", x|y)  // "00100110", the union {1, 2, 5}
  fmt.Printf("%08b\n", x^y)  // "00100100", the symmetric difference {2, 5}
  fmt.Printf("%08b\n", x&^y) // "00100000", the difference {5}
  for i := uint(0); i < 8; i++ {
      if x&(1<<i) != 0 { // membership test
          fmt.Println(i) // "1", "5"
      } 
  }
  fmt.Printf("%08b\n", x<<1) // "01000100", the set {2, 6}
  fmt.Printf("%08b\n", x>>1) // "00010001", the set {0, 4}
```
(Section 6.5 shows an implementation of integer sets that can be much bigger than a byte.)

In the shift operations `x<<n` and `x>>n`, the `n` operand determines the number of bit positions to shift and must be unsigned; the x operand may be unsigned or signed. Arithmetically, a left shift `x<<n` is equivalent to multiplication by $2^n$ and a right shift `x>>n` is equivalent to the floor of division by $2^n$.

Left shifts fill the vacated bits with zeros, as do right shifts of unsigned numbers, but right shifts of signed numbers fill the vacated bits with copies of the sign bit. For this reason, it is important to use unsigned arithmetic when you’re treating an integer as a bit pattern.

Although Go provides unsigned numbers and arithmetic, we tend to use the signed `int` form even for quantities that can’t be negative, such as the length of an array, though `uint` might seem a more obvious choice. Indeed, the built-in len function returns a signed int, as in this loop which announces prize medals in reverse order:
```go
  medals := []string{"gold", "silver", "bronze"}
  for i := len(medals) - 1; i >= 0; i-- {
      fmt.Println(medals[i]) // "bronze", "silver", "gold"
  }
```

The alternative would be calamitous. If `len` returned an unsigned number, then `i` too would be a `uint`, and the condition `i >= 0` would always be true by definition. After the third iteration, in which `i == 0`, the `i--` statement would cause `i` to become not `−1`, but the maximum uint value (for example, $2^{64}−1$), and the evaluation of `medals[i]` would fail at run time, or *panic* (§5.9), by attempting to access an element outside the bounds of the slice.

For this reason, unsigned numbers tend to be used only when their bitwise operators or peculiar arithmetic operators are required, as when implementing bit sets, parsing binary file formats, or for hashing and cryptography. They are typically not used for merely non-negative quantities.

In general, an explicit conversion is required to convert a value from one type to another, and binary operators for arithmetic and logic (except shifts) must have operands of the same type. Although this occasionally results in longer expressions, it also eliminates a whole class of problems and makes programs easier to understand.

As an example familiar from other contexts, consider this sequence:
```go
  var apples int32 = 1
  var oranges int16 = 2
  var compote int = apples + oranges // compile error
```
Attempting to compile these three declarations produces an error message:
```
  invalid operation: apples + oranges (mismatched types int32 and int16)
```
This type mismatch can be fixed in several ways, most directly by converting everything to a common type:
```go
  var compote = int(apples) + int(oranges)
```

As described in Section 2.5, for every type `T`, the conversion operation `T(x)` converts the value `x` to type `T` if the conversion is allowed. Many integer-to-integer conversions do not entail any change in value; they just tell the compiler how to interpret a value. But a conversion that narrows a big integer into a smaller one, or a conversion from integer to floating-point or vice versa, may change the value or lose precision:
```go
  f := 3.141 // a float64
  i := int(f)
  fmt.Println(f, i)   // "3.141 3"
  f = 1.99
  fmt.Println(int(f)) // "1"
```
Float to integer conversion discards any fractional part, truncating toward zero. You should avoid conversions in which the operand is out of range for the target type, because the behavior depends on the implementation:
```go
  f := 1e100  // a float64
  i := int(f) // result is implementation-dependent
```
Integer literals of any size and type can be written as ordinary decimal numbers, or as octal numbers if they begin with `0`, as in `0666`, or as hexadecimal if they begin with `0x` or `0X`, as in `0xdeadbeef`. Hex digits may be upper or lower case. Nowadays octal numbers seem to be used for exactly one purpose—file permissions on POSIX systems—but hexadecimal numbers are widely used to emphasize the bit pattern of a number over its numeric value.

When printing numbers using the `fmt` package, we can control the radix and format with the `%d`, `%o`, and `%x` verbs, as shown in this example:
```go
  o := 0666
  fmt.Printf("%d %[1]o %#[1]o\n", o) // "438 666 0666"
  x := int64(0xdeadbeef)
  fmt.Printf("%d %[1]x %#[1]x %#[1]X\n", x)
  // Output:
  // 3735928559 deadbeef 0xdeadbeef 0XDEADBEEF
```

Note the use of two `fmt` tricks. Usually a `Printf` format string containing multiple `%` verbs would require the same number of extra operands, but the `[1]` "adverbs" after `%` tell `Printf` to use the first operand over and over again. Second, the `#` adverb for `%o` or `%x` or `%X` tells `Printf` to emit a `0` or `0x` or `0X` prefix respectively.

Rune literals are written as a character within single quotes. The simplest example is an ASCII character like `'a'`, but it’s possible to write any Unicode code point either directly or with numeric escapes, as we will see shortly.

Runes are printed with `%c`, or with `%q` if quoting is desired:
```go
  ascii := 'a'
  unicode := '⾙'
  newline := '\n'
  fmt.Printf("%d %[1]c %[1]q\n", ascii)   // "97 a 'a'" 
  fmt.Printf("%d %[1]c %[1]q\n", unicode) // "22269 ⾙ '⾙'" 
  fmt.Printf("%d %[1]q\n", newline)       // "10 '\n'"
```

## 3.2. Floating-Point Numbers 

Go provides two sizes of floating-point numbers, `float32` and `float64`. Their arithmetic properties are governed by the [IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754) standard implemented by all modern CPUs.

Values of these numeric types range from tiny to huge. The limits of floating-point values can be found in the [`math`](https://golang.org/pkg/math) package. The constant `math.MaxFloat32`, the largest `float32`, is about `3.4e38`, and `math.MaxFloat64` is about `1.8e308`. The smallest positive values are near `1.4e-45` and `4.9e-324`, respectively.

A `float32` provides approximately six decimal digits of precision, whereas a `float64` provides about 15 digits; `float64` should be preferred for most purposes because `float32` computations accumulate error rapidly unless one is quite careful, and the smallest positive integer that cannot be exactly represented as a `float32` is not large:
```go
  var f float32 = 16777216 // 1 << 24
  fmt.Println(f == f+1)    // "true"!
```
Floating-point numbers can be written literally using decimals, like this:
```go
  const e = 2.71828 // (approximately)
```
Digits may be omitted before the decimal point (`.707`) or after it (`1.`). Very small or very large numbers are better written in scientific notation, with the letter `e` or `E` preceding the decimal exponent:
```go
  const Avogadro = 6.02214129e23
  const Planck   = 6.62606957e-34
```
Floating-point values are conveniently printed with `Printf’s` `%g` verb, which chooses the most compact representation that has adequate precision, but for tables of data, the `%e` (exponent) or `%f` (no exponent) forms may be more appropriate. All three verbs allow field width and numeric precision to be controlled.
```go
  for x := 0; x < 8; x++ {
      fmt.Printf("x = %d eA = %8.3f\n", x, math.Exp(float64(x)))
  }
```
The code above prints the powers of *e* with three decimal digits of precision, aligned in an eight-character field:
|   `x`   |      $e^x$      |
| ------- | --------------- |
| x = 0 | $e^x$ = 1.000   |
| x = 1 | $e^x$ = 2.718   |
| x = 2 | $e^x$ = 7.389   |
| x = 3 | $e^x$ = 20.086  |
| x = 4 | $e^x$ = 54.598  |
| x = 5 | $e^x$ = 148.413 |
| x = 6 | $e^x$ = 403.429 |
| x = 7 | $e^x$ = 1096.63 |

In addition to a large collection of the usual mathematical functions, the `math` package has functions for creating and detecting the special values defined by IEEE 754: the positive and negative infinities, which represent numbers of excessive magnitude and the result of division by zero; and NaN ("not a number"), the result of such mathematically dubious operations as `0/0` or `Sqrt(-1)`.
```go
  var z float64
  fmt.Println(z, -z, 1/z, -1/z, z/z) //  "0 -0 +Inf -Inf NaN"
```

The function `math.IsNaN` tests whether its argument is a not-a-number value, and `math.NaN` returns such a value. It’s tempting to use NaN as a sentinel value in a numeric computation, but testing whether a specific computational result is equal to NaN is fraught with peril because any comparison with NaN always yields false:
```go
  nan := math.NaN()
  fmt.Println(nan == nan, nan < nan, nan > nan) // "false false false"
```

If a function that returns a floating-point result might fail, it’s better to report the failure separately, like this:
```go
  func compute() (value float64, ok bool) {
      // ...
      if failed {
          return 0, false
      }
      return result, true
  }
```

The next program illustrates floating-point graphics computation. It plots a function of two variables `z = f(x, y)` as a wire mesh 3-D surface, using Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), a standard XML notation for line drawings. Figure 3.1 shows an example of its output for the function `sin(r)/r`, where `r` is `sqrt(x*x+y*y)`.

```go
// tgpl.io/ch3/surface
// Surface computes an SVG rendering of a 3-D surface function.
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

const (
	width, height = 600, 320            // canvas size in pixels
	cells         = 100                 // number of grid cells
	xyrange       = 30.0                // axis ranges (-xyrange..+xyrange)
	xyscale       = width / 2 / xyrange // pixels per x or y unit
	zscale        = height * 0.4        // pixels per z unit
	angle         = math.Pi / 6         // angle of x, y axes (=30°)
)

var sin30, cos30 = math.Sin(angle), math.Cos(angle) // sin(30°), cos(30°)

func main() {
	fmt.Printf("<svg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' "+
		"style='stroke: grey; fill: white; stroke-width: 0.7' "+
		"width='%d' height='%d'>", width, height)
	for i := 0; i < cells; i++ {
		for j := 0; j < cells; j++ {
			ax, ay := corner(i+1, j)
			bx, by := corner(i, j)
			cx, cy := corner(i, j+1)
			dx, dy := corner(i+1, j+1)
			fmt.Printf("<polygon points='%g,%g %g,%g %g,%g %g,%g'/>\n",
				ax, ay, bx, by, cx, cy, dx, dy)
		}
	}
	fmt.Println("</svg>")
}

func corner(i, j int) (float64, float64) {
	// Find point (x,y) at corner of cell (i,j).
	x := xyrange * (float64(i)/cells - 0.5)
	y := xyrange * (float64(j)/cells - 0.5)

	// Compute surface height z.
	z := f(x, y)

	// Project (x,y,z) isometrically onto 2-D SVG canvas (sx,sy).
	sx := width/2 + (x-y)*cos30*xyscale
	sy := height/2 + (x+y)*sin30*xyscale - z*zscale
	return sx, sy
}

func f(x, y float64) float64 {
	r := math.Hypot(x, y) // distance from (0,0)
	return math.Sin(r) / r
}
```

Notice that the function `corner` returns two values, the coordinates of the corner of the cell.

The explanation of how the program works requires only basic geometry, but it’s fine to skip over it, since the point is to illustrate floating-point computation. The essence of the program is mapping between three different coordinate systems, shown in Figure 3.2. The first is a 2-D grid of 100x100 cells identified by integer coordinates (*i*, *j*), starting at (0, 0) in the far back corner. We plot from the back to the front so that background polygons may be obscured by foreground ones.

The second coordinate system is a mesh of 3-D floating-point coordinates (*x*, *y*, *z*), where *x* and *y* are linear functions of *i* and *j*, translated so that the origin is in the center, and scaled by the constant `xyrange`. The height *z* is the value of the surface function *f(x, y)*.

The third coordinate system is the 2-D image canvas, with (0, 0) in the top left corner. Points in this plane are denoted (*sx*, *sy*). We use an isometric projection to map each 3-D point (*x*, *y*, *z*) onto the 2-D canvas. A point appears farther to the right on the canvas the greater its *x* value or the *smaller* its y value. And a point appears farther down the canvas the greater its *x* value or *y* value, and the smaller its *z* value. The vertical and horizontal scale factors for *x* and *y* are derived from the sine and cosine of a 30° angle. The scale factor for *z*, 0.4, is an arbitrary parameter.

For each cell in the 2-D grid, the main function computes the coordinates on the image canvas of the four corners of the polygon *ABCD*, where B corresponds to (*i*, *j*) and *A*, *C*, and *D* are its neighbors, then prints an SVG instruction to draw it.

### Exercises
- **Exercise 3.1**: If the function `f` returns a non-finite `float64` value, the SVG file will contain invalid `<polygon>` elements (although many SVG renderers handle this gracefully). Modify the program to skip invalid polygons.
- **Exercise 3.2**: Experiment with visualizations of other functions from the `math` package. Can you produce an egg box, moguls, or a saddle?
- **Exercise 3.3**: Color each polygon based on its height, so that the peaks are colored red (`#ff0000`) and the valleys blue (`#0000ff`).
- **Exercise 3.4**: Following the approach of the Lissajous example in Section 1.7, construct a web server that computes surfaces and writes SVG data to the client. The server must set the `Content-Type` header like this:
```go
  w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "image/svg+xml")
```
(This step was not required in the Lissajous example because the server uses standard heuristics to recognize common formats like PNG from the first 512 bytes of the response and generates the proper header.) Allow the client to specify values like height, width, and color as HTTP request parameters.


## 3.3. Complex Numbers 

Go provides two sizes of complex numbers, `complex64` and `complex128`, whose components are `float32` and `float64` respectively. The built-in function `complex` creates a complex number from its real and imaginary components, and the built-in `real` and `imag` functions extract those components:
```go
  var x complex128 = complex(1, 2) // 1+2i
  var y complex128 = complex(3, 4) // 3+4i
  fmt.Println(x*y)                 // "(-5+10i)"
  fmt.Println(real(x*y))           // "-5"
  fmt.Println(imag(x*y))           // "10"
```

If a floating-point literal or decimal integer literal is immediately followed by `i`, such as `3.141592i` or `2i`, it becomes an *imaginary literal*, denoting a complex number with a zero real component:
```go
  fmt.Println(1i * 1i) // "(-1+0i)", $i^2$ = -1
```

Under the rules for constant arithmetic, complex constants can be added to other constants (integer or floating point, real or imaginary), allowing us to write complex numbers naturally, like `1+2i`, or equivalently, `2i+1`. The declarations of `x` and `y` above can be simplified:
```go
  x := 1 + 2i
  y := 3 + 4i
```

Complex numbers may be compared for equality with `==` and `!=`. Two complex numbers are equal if their real parts are equal and their imaginary parts are equal.

The `math/cmplx` package provides library functions for working with complex numbers, such as the complex square root and exponentiation functions.
```go
  fmt.Println(cmplx.Sqrt(-1)) // "(0+1i)"
```

The following program uses `complex128` arithmetic to generate a [Mandelbrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set).
```go
// tgpl.io/ch3/mandelbrot
// Mandelbrot emits a PNG image of the Mandelbrot fractal.
package main

import (
	"image"
	"image/color"
	"image/png"
	"math/cmplx"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	const (
		xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax = -2, -2, +2, +2
		width, height          = 1024, 1024
	)

	img := image.NewRGBA(image.Rect(0, 0, width, height))
	for py := 0; py < height; py++ {
		y := float64(py)/height*(ymax-ymin) + ymin

The two nested loops iterate over each point in a 1024x1024 grayscale raster image represent- ing the −2 to +2 portion of the complex plane. The program tests whether repeatedly squar- ing and adding the number that point represents eventually "escapes" the circle of radius 2. If so, the point is shaded by the number of iterations it took to escape. If not, the value belongs to the Mandelbrot set, and the point remains black. Finally, the program writes to its standard output the PNG-encoded image of the iconic fractal, shown in Figure 3.3.

### Exercises

- **Exercise 3.5**: Implement a full-color Mandelbrot set using the function `image.NewRGBA` and the type `color.RGBA` or `color.YCbCr`.
- **Exercise 3.6**: Supersampling is a technique to reduce the effect of pixelation by computing the color value at several points within each pixel and taking the average. The simplest method is to divide each pixel into four "subpixels." Implement it.
- **Exercise 3.7**: Another simple fractal uses Newton’s method to find complex solutions to a function such as $z^4−1 = 0$. Shade each starting point by the number of iterations required to get close to one of the four roots. Color each point by the root it approaches.

- **Exercise 3.8**: Rendering fractals at high zoom levels demands great arithmetic precision. Implement the same fractal using four different representations of numbers: `complex64`, `complex128`, `big.Float`, and `big.Rat`. (The latter two types are found in the `math/big` package. `Float` uses arbitrary but bounded-precision floating-point; `Rat` uses unbounded-precision rational numbers.) How do they compare in performance and memory usage? At what zoom levels do rendering artifacts become visible?

- **Exercise 3.9**: Write a web server that renders fractals and writes the image data to the client. Allow the client to specify the *x*, *y*, and zoom values as parameters to the HTTP request.

## 3.4. Booleans 

A value of type `bool`, or *boolean*, has only two possible values, `true` and `false`. The conditions in `if` and `for` statements are booleans, and comparison operators like `==` and `<` produce a boolean result. The unary operator `!` is logical negation, so `!true` is `false`, or, one might say, `(!true==false)==true`, although as a matter of style, we always simplify redundant boolean expressions like `x==true` to `x`.

Boolean values can be combined with the `&&` (AND) and `||` (OR) operators, which have *shortcircuit* behavior: if the answer is already determined by the value of the left operand, the right operand is not evaluated, making it safe to write expressions like this:
```go
  s != "" && s[0] == 'x'
```
where `s[0]` would panic if applied to an empty string.

Since `&&` has higher precedence than `||` (mnemonic: `&&` is boolean multiplication, `||` is boolean addition), no parentheses are required for conditions of this form:
```go
  if 'a' <= c && c <= 'z' ||
     'A' <= c && c <= 'Z' ||
     '0' <= c && c <= '9' {
     // ...ASCII letter or digit...
  }
```
There is no implicit conversion from a boolean value to a numeric value like 0 or 1, or vice versa. It’s necessary to use an explicit `if`, as in
```go
  i := 0 if b {
      i=1
  }
```
It might be worth writing a conversion function if this operation were needed often:
```go
  // btoi returns 1 if b is true and 0 if false.
  func btoi(b bool) int {
      if b { 
          return 1
      }
      return 0
  }
```
The inverse operation is so simple that it doesn’t warrant a function, but for symmetry here it is:
```go

  // itob reports whether i is non-zero.
  func itob(i int) bool { return i != 0 }
```
